Exercise 1
Step 3: simpledb.Parser.handleQueryStatement()
 - A new logical plan is created from parseQueryLogicalPlan
 - A physical plan is created from the logical plan
 - A query is returned with the physical and logical plan

Step 4: simdledb.Parser.parseQueryLogicalPlan
 - Create a logical plan by evaluating the FROM clause first, 
   the WHERE clause second, and then FILTER, JOIN, GROUPBY, SELECT,
   picking out aggregates, checking the query for validity, and finally
   sorting.
